<p class ="speech WINDERMERE"> I think we’re very good friends already, Lord
    Darlington. We can always remain so as long as you don’t</p>

<h6 class="name ">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>
<p class ="speech WINDERMERE">Don’t spoil it by saying extravagant silly things to
    me. You think I am a Puritan, I suppose? Well, I have something of the
    Puritan in me. I was brought up like that. I am glad of it. My mother
    died when I was a mere child. I lived always with Lady Julia, my
    father’s elder sister, you know. She was stern to me, but she taught me
    what the world is forgetting, the difference that there is between what
    is right and what is wrong. _She_ allowed of no compromise. _I_ allow
    of none.</p>
