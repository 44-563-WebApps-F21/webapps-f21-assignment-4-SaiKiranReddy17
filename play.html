        <h3>Lady Windermere’s Fan</h3>
        <h4>ACT III._Lord Darlington’s rooms_.</h4>
        <p>
            <h6 class="name">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>
            <p class="speech DARLINGTON">We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.</p>

            <h6 class="name">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> 
            <p class="speech WINDERMERE">Why do you make that your special one?</p> 
            <p class="stage-direction"> [_Still seated at table L._]</p>
            
            <h6 class="name">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6> 
            <p class="stage-direction">[_Still seated L.C._]</p>
            <p class="speech DARLINGTON">Oh, nowadays so many conceited
            people go about Society pretending to be good, that I think it shows
            rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad.  Besides,
            there is this to be said.  If you pretend to be good, the world takes you
            very seriously.  If you pretend to be bad, it doesn’t.  Such is the
            astounding stupidity of optimism.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  
            <p class="speech WINDERMERE">Don’t you _want_ the world to take you seriously then,
            Lord Darlington?</p>
            
            <h6 class="name">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6> 
            <p class="speech DARLINGTON">No, not the world.  Who are the people the world takes
            seriously?  All the dull people one can think of, from the Bishops down
            to the bores.  I should like _you_ to take me very seriously, Lady
            Windermere, _you_ more than any one else in life.</p>
            
           <h6 class="name">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  
           <p class="speech WINDERMERE">Why—why me?</p>
            
            <h6 class="name">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6> 
            <p class="stage-direction">[_After a slight hesitation_.]</p> 
            <p class="speech DARLINGTON">Because I think we might be great friends.  Let us be great friends.  You may want a friend
            some day.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  
            <p class="speech WINDERMERE">Why do you say that?</p>
            
            <h6 class="name">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  
            <p class="speech DARLINGTON">Oh!—we all want friends at times.</p>
